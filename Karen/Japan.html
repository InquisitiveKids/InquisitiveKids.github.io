            The <i><b>Kimono</b></i> is the traditional dressing of the Japanese. Kimonos are made from a wide variety of fibre types, including hemp, linen, silk, crepe (known as chirimen), and figured satin weaves such as rinzu, with a cross collar and wide sleeves. It is made of rectangular pieces of fabric, with a wide belt rapped around
            the waist. It indicates the wearers' age, gender, sometimes the occasion, and the wearers' status. The pattern on the kimono also shows which season it should we worn, for example, a pattern with butterflies or cherry blossoms would be worn in spring. Watery designs are common during the summer. A popular autumn motif is the russet leaf of the Japanese maple; for winter, designs may include bamboo, pine trees and plum blossoms (the Three Friends of Winter).
            Kimono textiles can to be classified into two categories: gofuku(呉服), which indicates silk textiles in general, and cotton/hemp futomono(太物) for everyday wear. Gofuku was named after 呉 (Wú) in ancient China, where the technology of silk fabrics originated from. Cotton clothing is called momenfuku(木綿服) whereas hemp clothing is called asafuku(麻服) in Japanese. Cotton/hemp fabrics are generally called as futomono (太物, Thick materials) as the fiber of these materials are thicker compared to that of silk. Till the end of the Edo period, tailoring of these fabrics were handled respectively at gofuku stores (Gofuku Dana) and futomono stores (Futomono Dana), however, after the Meiji period, kimono was not worn as daily wear very often and futomono stores eventually went out of business. 
            The kimono now is appeared mostly at summer festivals, weddings, and funerals, while the more easy-to-wear <a href = "#yukata">Yukata</a> is mostly worn regularly.

                <span style = "font-weight:500;">Education</span> for children in Japan is taken very seriously, and very competitive. Schoolchildren spend 240 days-or two thirds of the year-in school.Search Results
                
                In general, kids have to be at school by 8:45 am. School finishes around 3:15 pm, so they have to be in school for about six and a half hours every day from Monday to Friday. However, most kids also attend after-school clubs, and many also go to juku (cram school) in the evening to do extra studying.
                Also, Japanese schoolyears are made up of 3 terms, starting from April. <br><br>
