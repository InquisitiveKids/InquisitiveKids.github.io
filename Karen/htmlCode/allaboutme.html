            My name is Karen. I'm about to become a third grader, and I'm 8 years old. I'm a very energetic and smart person - I work out every day at dusk with my family,
            often my mother and sister. I've also made many webpages - I know <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/js/" class = "codingtypes">JS</a>, <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/html/" class = "codingtypes">HTML</a>, <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/css/" class = "codingtypes">CSS</a>, and working on <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/sql/" class = "codingtypes">SQL</a>.

        <p id = "childhood">
            When I was 3 years old, my parent sent me and my twin sister, Kalie, to live with our grandparents in <a href = "https://www.google.com/search?q=changzhou+jiangsu&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS824US824&oq=chan&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j46j69i57j0l2j69i60l2j69i61.605j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">ChangZhou</a>, China.
            Many of my fathers' family lived there-I had many older, younger cousins, aunts and uncles, grandaunts, granduncles, and my great-grandmother. I also went to school.
            My father's sister-my aunt- was a Chinese preschool teacher. Every day she would bring us to her school. All we were expected to do was sit and watch, but me and Kalie
            got <em>actual</em> knowledge out of it.
