        <p style="font-size: 20px; color:deeppink">The Gym is the biggest part of the school building. It is kind of like a huge basketball court, with basketball hoops on the sides.<br>
            There is also two teachers: Mr. Ientile and Ms.Venezia. A curtain splits the gym into halves, one side to each teacher. Bleachers line three sides, while the
            fourth side is covered with mats. The gym is also for another subject, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/Karen/music.html">music</a>. At assemblies and Spring Concerts, there is a 
            projector that can roll and unroll from the ceilling.

        <p>
            The Kids Heart Challenge is a organization and funding for kids who have heart problems. Davis School
            have participated in the challenge for many years. <br>
            Kids Heart Challenge for Davis School usually starts around March. There are <a href = "#firstwaytodonate">two ways</a> of donating money:<br><br>
            <div id = "firstwaytodonate"><b style="font-size:large; font-family:verdana;"> Donating by Form</b>
            <br><div style = "color:white; font-size:larger;">
            At PE class sometime your teacher would give you a Kids Heart Challenge form for parents or guardians to fill out. <br>It should come with a short article, and 
            list of prizes you could get. Remember, you do not <i>have</i> to donate        money. It is an option. Then hand the form to your teacher.</div></div>

                The next way of donating is by using the <a href = "https://www2.heart.org/site/SPageServer;jsessionid=00000000.app322a?pagename=khc_resources_search&NONCE_TOKEN=C1FE4A3F3594A7C47D9D4A5F437E62B6">Kids Heart Challenge App</a>. The first step after you get on the app is to

                What do children do at PE classes? Here is an intreview from an 2020 second grade student
                and what her class liked the most at their survey.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:18px;font-family: cursive; background-color:salmon; color: white; width: 40%; border: 8px solid rgb(255, 66, 85); padding: 4px;">
                Hi, I am Karen Jia from Room 246 and I'm here to tell you about this year's survey on best PE activities. 
                When my class voted about what games they liked the best, I wasn't surprised to see what they picked. We had played 
                this game quite a few times, and it's called <i style="font-family: georgia;">Battleship</i>. Battleship is a game where we 
                set up four mats near each corner of our side of the gym and place four bowling pins on the corner of each mat. We pretend 
                that the mats are the ships. The goal is to sink other ships by throwing a ball and hitting all of the pins down of a ship.
                Also, on each team there is a 'scubadiver'. The scubadiver is picked by the team, and is for taking balls from the ground and 
                bring them back to their <a href = "#peteams">team</a>. Throwers on each team could also gather balls for themselves, as long as 
                only one feet is touching the ground. Other rules are that if your team's pins are all knocked and your ship is sunk, you have to 
                'swim' to another ship and join the team. The team who survives last wins.<br><br>
                Another popular game that we played many times in first grade was another version of kickball. Our teacher then, Ms. Venezia
