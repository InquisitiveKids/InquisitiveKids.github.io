        <h2 style = "font-weight:lighter; color:forestgreen;"> The Gym</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; color:deeppink">The Gym is the biggest part of the school building. It is kind of like a huge basketball court, with basketball hoops on the sides.<br>
            There is also two teachers: Mr. Ientile and Ms.Venezia. A curtain splits the gym into halves, one side to each teacher. Bleachers line three sides, while the
            fourth side is covered with mats. The gym is also for another subject, <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/Karen/music.html">music</a>. At assemblies and Spring Concerts, there is a 
            projector that can roll and unroll from the ceilling.

        <h2 style="font-weight: lighter;">Kids Heart Challenge</h2>
        <p>
            The Kids Heart Challenge is a organization and funding for kids who have heart problems. Davis School
            have participated in the challenge for many years. <br>
            Kids Heart Challenge for Davis School usually starts around March. There are two ways of donating money:<br><br>
            <div id = "firstwaytodonate"><b style="font-size:large; font-family:verdana;"> Donating by Form</b>
            <br><div style = "color:white; font-size:larger;">
            At PE class sometime your teacher would give you a Kids Heart Challenge form for parents or guardians to fill out. <br>It should come with a short article, and 
            list of prizes you could get. Remember, you do not <i>have</i> to donate money. It is an option. Then hand the form to your teacher.</div></div>
            <br><br>
            <div id = "secondwaytodonate">
                <div style="font-size:large; font-family:fantasy;">The Kids Heart Challenge App</div>
                The next way of donating is by using the Kids Heart Challenge App. The first step after you get on the app is to 
                register. You can get a little bracelet just by registering! Then start donating!
