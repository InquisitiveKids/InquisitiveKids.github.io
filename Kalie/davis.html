            The Visual Art curriculum introduces the visual arts to young children through the exploration of a variety of media, 
            presented in conjunction with elements and principles of design, in order to stimulate and nurture their creative potential 
            and development. In addition, children learn through artistic activities how the visual arts relate to other disciplines 
            and classroom curriculums. The Davis School visual art curriculum is part of a system wide curriculum and is shaped by the 
            Massachusetts Arts Frameworks.

            Children will be exposed to a variety of mediums, methods and topics. These will consist of graphic mediums, 
            such as markers, pencils, and crayons; paint mediums, such as watercolor, tempera, and finger paint; 
            three-dimensional mediums, such as clay, wood, and recycled materials; basic printmaking techniques; 
            and basic computer applications. Works produced with these materials will range from the direct observation of 
            still life objects to themes and subjects that appeal to the world of fantasy and imagination. 
            Students are encouraged to take risks and be experimental in attempting to communicate meaningful ideas and feelings.
