                    <h2>Sound of Silence</h2>
                    <p>
                        Hello darkness, my old friend<br>
                        I've come to talk with you again<br>
                        Because a vision softly creeping<br>
                        Left its seeds while I was sleeping<br>
                        And the vision that was planted in my brain<br>
                        Still remains<br>
                        Within the sound of silence
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In restless dreams I walked alone<br>
                        Narrow streets of cobblestone<br>
                        'Neath the halo of a street lamp<br>
                        I turned my collar to the cold and damp<br>
                        When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light<br>
                        That split the night<br>
                        And touched the sound of silence
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And in the naked light I saw<br>
                        Ten thousand people, maybe more<br>
                        People talking without speaking<br>
                        People hearing without listening<br>
                        People writing songs that voices never share<br>
                        And no one dared<br>
                        Disturb the sound of silence
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Fools, " said I, "You do not know<br>
                        Silence, like a cancer, grows<br>
                        Hear my words that I might teach you<br>
                        Take my arms that I might reach you"<br>
                        But my words, like silent raindrops fell<br>
                        And echoed in the wells, of silence
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And the people bowed and prayed<br>
                        To the neon god they made<br>
                        And the sign flashed out its warning<br>
                        In the words that it was forming<br>
                        And the sign said, "The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls<br>
                        And tenement halls"<br>
                        And whispered in the sounds of silence
                    </p>

                    <h2>A Million Dreams</h2>
                    <p>
                        I close my eyes and I can see<br>
                        The world that's waiting up for me<br>
                        That I call my own<br>
                        Through the dark, through the door<br>
                        Through where no one's been before<br>
                        But it feels like home
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy<br>
                        They can say, they can say I've lost my mind<br>
                        I don't care, I don't care, so call me crazy<br>
                        We can live in a world that we design
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        'Cause every night I lie in bed<br>
                        The brightest colors fill my head<br>
                        A million dreams are keeping me awake<br>
                        I think of what the world could be<br>
                        A vision of the one I see<br>
                        A million dreams is all it's gonna take<br>
                        A million dreams for the world we're gonna make
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There's a house we can build<br>
                        Every room inside is filled<br>
                        With things from far away<br>
                        The special things I compile<br>
                        Each one there to make you smile<br>
                        On a rainy day
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy<br>
                        They can say, they can say we've lost our minds<br>
                        I don't care, I don't care if they call us crazy<br>
                        Runaway to a world that we design
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Every night I lie in bed<br>
                        The brightest colors fill my head<br>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However big, however small<br>
                        Let me be part of it all<br>
                        Share your dreams with me<br>
                        You may be right, you may be wrong<br>
                        But say that you'll bring me along<br>
                        To the world you see<br>
                        To the world I close my eyes to see<br>
